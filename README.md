花樣年華 (romanized: hwa-yang-yeon-hwa; literal trans: flower-like years) refers to the fleeting years of youth, beauty, and love. It is translated to English as “the most beautiful moments in life”, at the expense of its original poignant, nostalgic, and almost fragile connotation. For this project, I want to create drawings that could only be experienced once on the page. I also want to create drawings that are hidden entirely and require user interactions to reveal themselves. These may include elements that disappear after their animations finish, structures that collapse after a scrolling distance, scenes that are only visible through mouse activity tracking. In short, I want to create an overall experience as fragile as 花樣年華. 

Some technologies that I will definitely make use of include the Canvas, Js-controlled animations, and CSS3 3D capability. I definitely want to highlight user activities in this project (to an extent and in a fashion that makes sense, of course). I am much of a scene-maker than a shape-maker, and in order to create powerful scene experiences, I will need the help of some UX.

Aesthetically, these drawings will be inspired by traditional East Asian landscape paintings and attempt to capture the essence of 花樣年華.
